/*In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to check multiple conditions:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if(a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if(a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}
The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}

Use multiple conditional operators in the checkSign function to check if a number is positive, negative or zero.*/

function checkSign(num) {
  
}

checkSign(10);
