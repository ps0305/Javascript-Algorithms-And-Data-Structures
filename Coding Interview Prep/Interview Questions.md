## What is a debounce function?

Debounce function limits the execution of a function call and waits for a certain amount of time before running it again.

```js
const debounceFunc = (func, delay) => {
   let timer;
    return function(...args) {
       const context = this;
       clearTimeOut(timer);
       timer = setTimeOut(() => {
           func.apply(context, args);
       }, delay)
     }}
```

## What is throttle function?

Throttling is a technique, to limit the execution of an event handler function, even when this event triggers continuously due to user actions. (ex: browser resizing)

```js
const throttleFunc = (func, interval) => {
     let shouldFire = true;
   return function() {
         if (shouldFire) {
             func();
             shouldFire = false;
             setTimeOut(() => {
               shouldFire = true;
              }, interval)
            }
       }
  }
```
